**DevOps Home Lab**

This repository contains a small collection of configuration files to create a very basic DevOps home lab for an IT infrastructure professional.

It uses Vagrant to provision three Ubuntu VMs. Then uses Ansible to deploy Docker and create a swarm.

This home lab was originally created for a TechTarget article, when the article is published I will ad a link from here.
